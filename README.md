# Description
This repository contains a Python script for gene expression analysis. The script allows users to convert DNA sequences to RNA and protein sequences, as well as reverse translate protein sequences back to RNA and DNA. It also incorporates customizable codon usage tables, making it adaptable for different organisms.

# Usage
To use the script, simply provide a DNA, RNA, or protein sequence as input. The script will automatically determine the type of sequence and perform the appropriate conversions. For detailed instructions and examples, refer to the code files within the repository.
